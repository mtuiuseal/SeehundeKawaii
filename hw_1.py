# 1. Guess The Number Game:
# -we will generate a random number with the help of randint() function from 1 to 100 and ask the user to guess it.
# -After every guess, the user will be told if the number is above or below the randomly generated number.
# -The user will win if they guess the number maximum five attempts.
# -Ask the user to stop or continue playing again.
# ***
# Add another situations like:
# level of game (hard (guess 3 times), medium (6 times), easy (10 times)
# assume that you have 100$, each game you spent 5$. Play game until you choose stop, report the game you win/lost and amount you have.
